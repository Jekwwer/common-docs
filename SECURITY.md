# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the `common-docs` repository
and provides instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

The `common-docs` repository does not include software or executable code
and is therefore not subject to version-specific security risks.
However, any discovered vulnerabilities in templates that could lead to unintended consequences
should be reported promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in any document templates within this repository:

1. Please email directly at [report@jekwwer.com][report@jekwwer.com] with the following details:

   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any potential fixes or workarounds you may suggest.

2. Alternatively, you can open a private security advisory on GitHub:
   - Navigate to the repository's [Security Advisories][Security Advisories].
   - Click on **Create security advisory** and follow the instructions.

I aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **48 hours** and provide a resolution or update within **7 days**.
