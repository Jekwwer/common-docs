# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the `{{REPO_OWNER}}/{{REPO_NAME}}` repository
and provides instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version                | Supported                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `{{LATEST_VERSION}}`   | ✅ Actively supported             |
| `{{PREVIOUS_VERSION}}` | ✅ Supported with limited updates |
| Older versions         | ❌ Not supported                  |

If your project is using an unsupported version, we recommend upgrading to the latest version
to benefit from security updates and fixes.

For non-software repositories (e.g., documentation or templates), version-specific risks are not applicable.
However, any discovered vulnerabilities should still be reported promptly.
